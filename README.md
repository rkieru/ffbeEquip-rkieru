# What is this?
The [FFBE Equip Project](https://github.com/lyrgard/ffbeEquip) still relies on Bootstrap 3.x as its core CSS framework. This project aims to transition to Bootstrap 4.x, overhaul the user experience, and reduce the projects dependency on third-party libraries made redundant by the Bootstrap 4.x upgrade.

# Specific Goals
  1) Introduce a revised 'Light' and 'Dark' theme, as well as a theme that aims to make the layout feel more like the FFBE game interface.
  2) Enhance the sites ability to responsively display information on both mobile and desktop devices.
  3) Improve UX consistency for user actions that have expanded over the years (ex. Import Espers)
